# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis
Analysis of AirBNB
Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has revolutionized travel by offering a unique and personalized alternative to traditional accommodations. With a global user base, the analysis of millions of Airbnb listings is crucial for the company's operations. This extensive dataset provides valuable insights into security measures, business strategies, guest and host behavior, platform performance, marketing initiatives, and the development of new services. Airbnb functions as an online marketplace connecting hosts offering accommodations with guests seeking lodging in specific locations. The project aims to gather and analyze detailed booking information within neighborhood groups to generate insights tailored to user preferences, room types, and pricing. With approximately 49,000 observations across 16 columns containing both categorical and numeric data, our analysis aims to uncover meaningful relationships and their potential business implications.
